# Overview
Aaveq Robotics develops unmanned boats to sail in arctic conditions, handling logistics between towns and smaller settlements.

Our focus and first step is tackling the waste management problem in Greenland, halting the endless growth of garbage dumps in the smaller settlements, where it is neither effective nor always possible to send larger manned ships to collect the waste.

The large dumps are a threat to the environment, as well as the health of the local population. 

This project is owned by Aaveq Robotics ApS and is a spin-out from SDU.
